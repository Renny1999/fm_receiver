Compiling the Code: <br />
* Flags needed before -o <br />
  * -pthread
* Flags needed after -o (for linking library)
  * -lSoapySDR  (needed to use SoapySDR)
  * -lfftw3f  (needed to use fftw3's float version)

TODOs: <br />
* [x] The dec_rate for mono audio extraction is 4.5, which was floored down to 4
  * This can cause audio to sound incorrect, so maybe perform interpolation then decimate?
  * SOLVED by using sample rates and decimation rates to perfectly achieve 48kHz sample frequency
* [ ] Complex number multiplication in stage_1_filtering_thread is more expensive than simply mulplying by a double
  * We know the coefficients in the butterworth filter difference equation are all real, so maybe take advantage of that?
* [ ] Work on the `LR_diff_extraction_thread.cpp`<br />
  * [ ] Multiply the LR_diff_recovery signal with the pilot signal to move the L-R spectrum to the baseband
  * [ ] Lowpass filter the resulting signal at 15kHz
  * [ ] Decimate the signal to 48kHz 
* [ ] Take care of memory leaks

Notes: <br />
* Fs = 1.44MHz
  * First decimation: 1.44MHz / 3 = 480kHz
  * Second decimation: 480kHz / 10 = 48kHz
* stage 1 filtering thread was really slow, and could no keep up with the 1MHz+ sample rate
  * Three approaches were taken:
    1. [TOO SLOW] use the difference equation acquired from butterworth filter:
       * a<sub>0</sub>y[n] = b<sub>0</sub>x[n] + b<sub>1</sub>x[n-1] + b<sub>2</sub>x[n-2] + ... + b<sub>N</sub>x[n-N] - a<sub>1</sub>y[n-1] - b<sub>2</sub>y[n-2] + ... + a<sub>M</sub>y[n-M] <br />
       * This approach did not work mainly because the with a 3rd order butterworth filter, 8 multiplications for each sample was too slow.
       * Since the filtered signal is decimated, some y[n] are not used. however, the difference equation requires to know all y[n] values
       
    2. [NOISY] Filtering in Fourier domain: used fftw for FFT and iFFT:
       * The speed was decent, but the filtered signal ended up being fairly noisy due to the ripples caused by the FFT
    3. [SATISFACTORY] convolution with FIR filter impulse response:
       * y[n] = h[0]x[n] + h[1]x[n-1] + ... + h[j]x[n-j]
       * This method does not require any previous y value to calculate y[n]
       * The program can skip the convolution process on samples that will be dropped during decimated without causing any inconvenience
         * This approach only requires 1/dec_rate convolutions, making it even faster than the FFT approach
* Butterworth filters had better filter performance compared to the remez filters, but were slower to apply.
  * Originally, I used `std::deque<T>` to keep track to the past values for x and y, but the `[]` operator for `std::deque<T>` seemed to be slow
  * Since the difference equation method only need to accesss the past values for x and y incrementally, like `hist_x[0], hist_x[1], hist_x[2]...` where `hist_x[i] = x[n-i]`, the random access property in `std::deque<T>` was not necessary.
  * I made a `Deque<T>` class implemented using Linked List, and instead of using `deque[i]`, I prepared a `temp` pointer pointing at the first element of the `Deque`, and moved it to `temp->next` in each iteration of the loop.
  * This approach turned out to be faster than accessing past values using `deque[i]`, and made the use of butterworth filter difference equations viable in some occasions.
  * Now that I think about it, an iterator for `std::deque<T>` might have achieved the same effect.

Worth Noting: <br />
  * The filters used in the project are designed using scipy's signal library
  * Lowpass filters are designed using "remez", and bandpass filters are designed using "butter"
    * scipy's "butter" function might generate unstable filters when the order is high
